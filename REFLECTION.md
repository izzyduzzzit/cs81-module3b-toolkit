# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Assignment 3B Math Toolkit

## This is my reflections file to reflect upon what I learned from this assignment.

## What patterns or surprises did you notice?
# I didn't notice anything unusual. The functions I created worked as expected and the Git commands became routine.

## What logic challenged your thinking?
# Getting used to the Git commands challenged me, but then I remembered the syntax after a while.

## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
# This math toolkit showed me how to create what I think could be a library to call from another file which would allow me to use the functions within the library. This specific toolkit could be useful for basic math operations.
