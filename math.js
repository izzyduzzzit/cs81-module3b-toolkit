// Izarra Villareal CS 81 Javascript Assignment 3B Math Toolkit

// This toolkit provides a set of mathematical functions that can be used in various applications.
// Each function is designed to perform a specific mathematical operation.
// The functions are simple and can be easily integrated into larger projects.

// This function takes a number as input and returns its double.
// It is useful for calculations that require doubling a number, such as in financial applications or data processing.
// The function is straightforward and uses the multiplication operator to compute the double.
function double(n) {
  return n * 2;
}

console.log(double(5)); // Example usage of the double function

// This function takes a number as input and returns its square.
// It is useful for calculations that require squaring a number, such as in geometry or physics.
// The function is straightforward and uses the multiplication operator to compute the square.
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

console.log(square(5)); // Example usage of the square function
